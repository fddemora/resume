# Resume

I started building my resume from here https://github.com/drehimself/resume-template <br/>
I chose this template because it looked simple and professional.  <br/>

**Technologies used**:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- NPM
- Parcel


## Quick start to running my resume locally:
In your terminal or cmd <br/>
run https: `git clone https://github.com/fddemora/resume.git` <br/>
or run ssh: `git clone git@github.com:fddemora/resume.git` <br/>

Next run    `cd resume`  <br/>

Make sure you have node js installed in your computer to run npm. I use nvm to install node but there is a better option out there. Follow the command here:

```
# install Volta
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash

# install Node
volta install node

# start using Node
node
```
curl is a unix command. If you are a windows user, check out this installation guide [volta install](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started)


Lastly, run npm to install our devDependencies and run our parcel server: <br/>
```
npm install
npm run start
```

To access the server, run localhost:1234 on your browser.
